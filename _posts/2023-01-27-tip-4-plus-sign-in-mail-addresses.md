Some email providers allow sub addressing / plus addressing. Using a ``+`` and an arbitrary text (tag) before the @ sign, creates a disposable ad-hoc email address.

This works at least with gmail and live/outlook. Instead of using your regular email address, let's say ``firstname.lastname@live.com``, you would use ``firstname.lastname+SomeTag@live.com``.

This is specifically useful to send yourself notes, apply rules to in your mailbox when signing up for newsletters, or find out who is leaking your account ``firstname.lastname+ShadyWebsite@live.com``. Later partially works, as this trick is widely known.[^1]

> Some services require you to unsubscribe or delete the account sending an email that you signed up with. You only receive mails plus addressed.

[^1]: Some webforms do not allow the plus character.

Do you know any other providers that allow that? Let me know in the comments.
