If you need to run an application on Windows with elevated rights, there is a useful keyboard shortcut do to so. Search the application in your start menu, make sure it's highlighted and use the following keyboard shortcut:

> ``CTRL`` + ``SHIFT`` + ``ENTER``
{: .prompt-info }

To quickly open a terminal with elevated rights without using the mouse, use this sequence:

> ```WIN``` + ```R```, type ```cmd``` (or wt) and start it elevated with ```CTRL``` + ```SHIFT``` + ```ENTER```
{: .prompt-info }
