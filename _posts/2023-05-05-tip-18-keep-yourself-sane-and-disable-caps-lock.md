### TL;DR: Disable the `CAPS LOCK` key and replace it with for instance the back tick `` ` ``

Countless times I was annoyed by the fact that CAPS was on, because I hit the `CAPS LOCK` key by accident.  
**I HAVE YET TO FIND A GOOD REASON TO WRITE IN ALL CAPS FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME**. (I wrote this with the `SHIFT` modifier, not `CAPS LOCK` ðŸ˜œ)  

It's one of the few key modifiers that are toggled by a single key press. Of course, it's simply hitting the key **once** again to disable it, but it's still annoying. For whatever reason my brain and fingers don't seem to learn the mechanics of this key. Maybe I am alone with this problem, but I doubt it.  

After many years of suffering, I finally decided to disable the `CAPS LOCK` key, actually even better, **replacing** it with the [back tick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtick#:~:text=It%20is%20also%20known%20as%20backquote%2C%20grave%2C%20or%20grave%20accent) `` ` ``. I use the back tick quite often, especially in Markdown and on the Swiss German keyboard layout it is quite some finger yoga to type it.  

I am not going to explain how to disable the `CAPS LOCK` key, there are many ways to do it. Can be OS, keyboard software or in my case, keyboard firmware specific. I recently bought a new keyboard [Keychron K8 pro ISO RGB](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k8-pro-qmk-via-wireless-mechanical-keyboard-iso-layout-collection?variant=40283914600537), which I am quite happy with, after going through several compiling hoops.
